\section*{Introduction}

Physical activity (PA) has long been established as one of the main contributors to prevent chronic diseases and promote health {\tiny (Kaminsky LA, J Am Hear Assoc. 2014;3(5):e001430; Warburton DER. Curr Opin Cardiol. 2017;32(5):541–56.)}. Evidence shows that lack of PA leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, several types of cancer and a higher mortality rate {\tiny (Guthold R. Lancet Glob Heal. 2018;6(10):e1077–86., Lee IM. Lancet. 2012;380(9838):219–29; Shiroma EJ. J Am Heart Assoc. 2014;3(5):7–9.)}. Given the relevant relationship between PA and health, there is an increasing need of accurate and reliable methods of PA assessment on daily life {\tiny (Montoye HJ. Med Sci Sport Exerc. 2000;32(9 Suppl):S439–41.; Plasqui G. Obes Rev. 2013;14(6):451–62; Strath SJ. Circulation. 2013;128(20):2259–79)}. These methods can be either subjective, such as questionnaires, or objective, as direct observation and wearable devices {\tiny (Strath SJ. Circulation. 2013;128(20):2259–79; Troiano RP. Med Sci Sport Exerc. 2005;37(Supplement):S487–9)}.\\

\noindent
The most commonly used wearable devices to assess PA are accelerometers {\tiny (Strath SJ. Circulation. 2013;128(20):2259–79)}, described as devices that detect the body movement accelerations in one to three orthogonal planes (anteroposterior, mediolateral, and vertical) {\tiny (Chen KY. Med Sci Sport Exerc. 2005;37(Supplement):S490–500)}. The accelerometers output can be either raw acceleration, usually expressed as gravitational acceleration units (\textit{g}), or activity counts, which are processed data derived from the raw acceleration and are based on manufacturer-specific algorithm {\tiny (Chen KY. Med Sci Sport Exerc. 2005;37(Supplement):S490–500; Bassett  Jr. Med Sci Sport Exerc. 2012;44(1 Suppl 1):S32-8; Troiano RP. Br J Sports Med. 2014;48(13):1019–23)}. In both cases, the accelerometer output needs to be translated into more physiologically meaningful information through a calibration process {\tiny (Matthews CE. Med Sci Sport Exerc. 2005;37(11 (Suppl)):S512–22.)}. \\
