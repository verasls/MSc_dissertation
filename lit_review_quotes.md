# Physical activity
- Functional ability (or the restriction of it) is a determining factor in independent living. A person’s level of functional ability has a significant impact on quality of life. Many tools have been developed to assist in the assessment of functional ability.
**Mathie MJ. Physiol Meas. 2004;25(2):R1-R20.**

- The term PA is used to describe various aspects of an indivi- dual’s daily behaviours (sports, occupation), activities (walking, running, swimming) and bodily movements.
**Troiano RP. Br J Sports Med. 2014;48(13):1019-23.**

- Summary measures of PA extracted from motion sensors and self-report instruments have commonly been expressed using nominally the same metrics, such as minutes/day in specific intensity categories (eg, moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) minutes or MET-minutes).

# Accelerometers

- The difficulties with these approaches (other measurement devices) are that they are either time consuming and expensive, requiring access to specialized equipment and a dedicated laboratory set-up, or they are subjective and rely on clinician observation or patient recall. Moreover, measurements of movements made in the clinic may not accurately reflect functional ability in the patient’s normal (home) environment (Kiani et al 1997). 
**Mathie MJ. Physiol Meas. 2004;25(2):R1-R20.**

- There is a need for systems that are able to provide low-cost, objective measurement of functional ability of free-living subjects in the home environment.
**Mathie MJ. Physiol Meas. 2004;25(2):R1-R20.**

- A range of body-fixed sensors including electromechanical switches (attached to the heel to identify timing of heel strike in gait), goniometers (to measure joint angles between body segments), accelerometers (to measure motion of body segments), gyroscopes (to measure orientation of body segments), pedometers and actometers have been used to measure aspects of human movement in free-living subjects. 
**Mathie MJ. Physiol Meas. 2004;25(2):R1-R20.**

- Accelerometers offer a number of desirable features in monitoring of human movement. Firstly, they respond to both frequency and intensity of movement, and so are superior to actometers or pedometers, which are attenuated by impact or tilt. Secondly, some types of accelerometers can be used to measure tilt as well as body movement, making them superior to motion sensors that have no ability to measure static characteristics. Thirdly, enhancements in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology have made possible the manufacture of miniaturized, low cost accelerometers. These instruments also demonstrate a high degree of reliability in measurement, with little variation over time (Bouten et al 1997a, Meijer et al 1991, Moe-Nilssen 1998, Hansson et al 2001). This has enabled the development of small, lightweight, portable systems that can be worn by a free-living subject without impeding movement. Systems can be designed that are suitable for monitoring in the patient’s normal environment over extended periods.
**Mathie MJ. Physiol Meas. 2004;25(2):R1-R20.**

- Questionnaires have historically been the main physical activity measurement instrument in epidemiological studies. However, accelerometers are currently a feasible alternative to objectively measure physical activity.
**Mendes MA. Gait Posture. 2018;61:98-110.**

- Regarding the disadvantages, accelerometers do not indicate the context and the purpose of the physical activities. Furthermore, accelerometers are not valid to measure specific physical activities such as isometric activities, physical activities against a resistance force (e.g. strength exercises) and cycling. However, the major source of overall physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) is derived form dynamic physical activities (e.g. walking, running), and these activities are accurately measured by accelerometers [2]. Data from accelerometers are also free of information bias introduced by interviewers or participants. The data are gathered by the devices at the exact moment in which the activities are taking place, providing a reliable physical activity measure in free-living conditions.
**Mendes MA. Gait Posture. 2018;61:98-110.**

- Accelerometer-based devices are now commonly used to characterise physical activity (PA) behaviour in research and consumer applications.
**Troiano RP. Br J Sports Med. 2014;48(13):1019-23.**

- The first accelerometer-based PA monitor to be adopted by researchers was developed in the 1980s,1 and the 1990s saw a proliferation of new research devices. During these early years, accelerometer-based devices were seen as an intri- guing, although niche, assessment technology due to limitations that included high device cost, as well as reliability, calibration and validity concerns.
**Troiano RP. Br J Sports Med. 2014;48(13):1019-23.**

- One major limitation of the accelerometry technologies at the time was minute-by-minute time resolution and ‘counts’ as the standard output.
**Troiano RP. Br J Sports Med. 2014;48(13):1019-23.**

- Not surprisingly, conflicts and debates about which monitor(s) to use, where to position them on the body, and how to process the data are still common in the field of PA research.

# Calibration and validation

- An important challenge regarding the use of accelerometers to measure physical activity lies in the interpretation of the signals provided by the devices, which need to be translated into measurements with biological and/or behavioral meaning. In this context, several calibration studies have been performed [4]. There are important methodological differences in calibration studies (e.g. sample sizes and characteristics, physical activity protocols and statistical approaches), which might influence the results of such studies. Accordingly, the accelerometer signal, which is one of the main variables analysed in these studies is not the same across studies. 
**Mendes MA. Gait Posture. 2018;61:98-110.**

- Direct comparison between count values from different accelerometer brands is limited, mainly because manufacturers use different undisclosed algorithms to define the acceleration outputs.
**Mendes MA. Gait Posture. 2018;61:98-110.**

- Table 1 indicates that most studies (15) placed the accelerometer on the waist of the participants, but it was also tested on other parts of the body (low back, wrist, foot, chest, waist, thigh and ankle).
**Mendes MA. Gait Posture. 2018;61:98-110.**

- The sample composition from accelerometry calibration studies hinders the extrapolation of their results to other settings [4]. Greater heterogeneity is required regarding the characteristics such as age, body mass index and physical fitness. Future calibration studies using more representative samples of their target populations in terms of demographic and physiological characteristics would represent an important step forward.
**Mendes MA. Gait Posture. 2018;61:98-110.**

- Considering that accelerometer-based physical activity assessment is mostly implemented in epidemiological studies interested in habitual physical activity, protocols from accelerometry calibration studies should be as close as possible to free-living activities.
**Mendes MA. Gait Posture. 2018;61:98-110.**

- A study conducted by Rosenberguer et al. [30], analyzing count-based acceleration signals, provided evidence that hip-worn accelerometer presents sedentary ac- tivity and physical activity measures more accurate than wrist-worn accelerometer. However, studies based on raw accelerometer data have shown different results. Wrist-worn accelerometers are able to provide accurate estimates regarding the activity type, PAEE, activity intensity similar to hip-worn devices [31]. In our review, which is restricted to raw data accelerometry, waist and wrist were the most frequently studied placements, and there was no evidence of any difference in the accuracy between them. 
**Mendes MA. Gait Posture. 2018;61:98-110.**

- NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), a large-scale study in the United States of America, collected data from hip-attached accelerometers in the first wave and changed to wrist placement thereafter. The decision was basically attributed to a greater compliance found to wrist-worn accelerometer in real life situations compared to waist-worn.
**Mendes MA. Gait Posture. 2018;61:98-110.**

- Another important topic is the potential advantage that has been attributed to raw data accelerometry, which is expected to generate better comparability between the results from different accelerometer brands. Although small differences might still occur between data col- lection from different brands, higher comparability will only be achieved if data reduction is performed in a standardized manner.
**Mendes MA. Gait Posture. 2018;61:98-110.**

- With the movement towards raw accelerometer data capture, it may even be possible to have approaches to allow direct comparison of results from different manufacturers’ devices. This result would contrast with the previous development of device-specific cut-point-based approaches for calibration of accelerometer-based devices, where results from different devices could not be directly compared and so many different analysis approaches existed that it was possible to shape the outcome of a study by the choice of a cut-point.

# Energy expenditure

- Accelerometry provides an indirect method for assessment of physical activity suitable for free-living environments that performs favourably when compared with other indirect methods such as self-reporting (Steele et al 2000, Ng and Kent-Braun 1997) and heart rate measurements (Fehling et al 1999, Bussmann et al 2000b).
**Mathie MJ. Physiol Meas. 2004;25(2):R1-R20.**

- Accelerometers have been used to study physical activity and energy expenditure in populations including healthy young subjects (Bouten et al 1996, Miller et al 1994), elderly subjects (Meijer et al 2001, Kochersberger et al 1996), patients with multiple sclerosis (Ng and Kent-Braun 1997), patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Steele et al 2000) and obese children (Coleman et al 1997, Epstein et al 1996, Trost et al 2001). 
**Mathie MJ. Physiol Meas. 2004;25(2):R1-R20.**

-Although most of the calibration regression equations estimate average PAEE relatively well for groups (of generally healthy adults and children), the challenges of predicting PAEE accurately for individuals and over a wide range of activities are also well known.
**Troiano RP. Br J Sports Med. 2014;48(13):1019-23.**

- Another concern within the PA research field is the comparability and accuracy of information extracted from acceleration signals recorded from different body locations. For example, the correlation between activity counts and PAEE from uniaxial accelerometers was found to be much lower when positioned on the wrist rather than at the hip.13 However, several recent studies that used features from triaxial raw accelerometer signals have narrowed the gap between PAEE estimates from wrist- worn and hip worn-accelerometers14 15 and for classifying PA into sedentary, household, walking and running types.
