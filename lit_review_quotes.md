# Physical activity
- Functional ability (or the restriction of it) is a determining factor in independent living. A person’s level of functional ability has a significant impact on quality of life. Many tools have been developed to assist in the assessment of functional ability.

# Accelerometers
- The difficulties with these approaches (other measurement devices) are that they are either time consuming and expensive, requiring access to specialized equipment and a dedicated laboratory set-up, or they are subjective and rely on clinician observation or patient recall. Moreover, measurements of movements made in the clinic may not accurately reflect functional ability in the patient’s normal (home) environment (Kiani et al 1997). 
**Mathie MJ. Physiol Meas. 2004;25(2):R1-R20.**

- There is a need for systems that are able to provide low-cost, objective measurement of functional ability of free-living subjects in the home environment.

- A range of body-fixed sensors including electromechanical switches (attached to the heel to identify timing of heel strike in gait), goniometers (to measure joint angles between body segments), accelerometers (to measure motion of body segments), gyroscopes (to measure orientation of body segments), pedometers and actometers have been used to measure aspects of human movement in free-living subjects.

- Accelerometers offer a number of desirable features in monitoring of human movement. Firstly, they respond to both frequency and intensity of movement, and so are superior to actometers or pedometers, which are attenuated by impact or tilt. Secondly, some types of accelerometers can be used to measure tilt as well as body movement, making them superior to motion sensors that have no ability to measure static characteristics. Thirdly, enhancements in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology have made possible the manufacture of miniaturized, low cost accelerometers. These instruments also demonstrate a high degree of reliability in measurement, with little variation over time (Bouten et al 1997a, Meijer et al 1991, Moe-Nilssen 1998, Hansson et al 2001). This has enabled the development of small, lightweight, portable systems that can be worn by a free-living subject without impeding movement. Systems can be designed that are suitable for monitoring in the patient’s normal environment over extended periods.

# Energy expenditure

- Accelerometry provides an indirect method for assessment of physical activity suitable for free-living environments that performs favourably when compared with other indirect methods such as self-reporting (Steele et al 2000, Ng and Kent-Braun 1997) and heart rate measurements (Fehling et al 1999, Bussmann et al 2000b).
**Mathie MJ. Physiol Meas. 2004;25(2):R1-R20.**

- Accelerometers have been used to study physical activity and energy expenditure in populations including healthy young subjects (Bouten et al 1996, Miller et al 1994), elderly subjects (Meijer et al 2001, Kochersberger et al 1996), patients with multiple sclerosis (Ng and Kent-Braun 1997), patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Steele et al 2000) and obese children (Coleman et al 1997, Epstein et al 1996, Trost et al 2001).
