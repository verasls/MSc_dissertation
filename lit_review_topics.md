## Physical activity
- Brief intro
- The importance of it and importance of measuring it
- Methods to measure physical activity
	+ Direct observation, questionnaires, pedometers, HR monitors, accelerometers...
- Disadvantages of these types of measures and measuring devices

## Accelerometers
- What is it and equipment characteristics
- How (and with which characteristics) accelerometers overcame these other equipment disadvantages?
- Advantages
- Uses of accelerometers
	+ Estimation of energy expenditure (EE) and classification of physical activity intensity (PAI)
	+ Estimation of ground reaction forces (GRF)
	+ Other uses: identification of postural sways, identification and classification of movement patterns...

## Calibration and validation
- Methodologic considerations
	+ Study design
		* Sample
		* Chosen activities
		* Criterion measure
- Statistical considerations
	+ Relationship between accelerometer output (activity counts or other metrics) and the criterion measure
	+ Internal and external validity
	+ Cross-validation and out-of-sample performance

## Accelerometers for EE estimation and PAI classification
- History and main studies
- Methodological advances
- Accelerometer metrics (activity counts and raw acceleration-based metrics)
- Existing methods for EE estimation and PAI classification
- Literature gap

## Accelerometers for GRF estimation
- History and main studies
- Methodological advances
- Existing methos for GRF estimation
- Literature gap
